This is my personal web page 💻 I'm not so happy with the result. I think I could be done better but I learnt a lot 📖📚💡 I'm not very experienced with Vue.js and I don't like the its version 3 path. This project it's made by Options API instead of Composition one. 

The project may change over the time, so you could find changes the next time you check it out 😉
